# Number Guessing Game

This project is my solution to the coding task discussed in the "Boolean Values (How To)" video as part of the JavaScript Basics course on Team Treehouse. The original task involved creating a simple script that compared a number given in a prompt with a preset number. I have enhanced this solution by building a web-based version using HTML, JavaScript, and Tailwind CSS.

## Features

- The user can guess a number between 1 and 10 using a browser-based form.
- The form is styled using DaisyUI and Tailwind CSS for a visually appealing interface.
- The user's input is validated to ensure that it falls within the range of 1 to 10.
- The number that the user is guessing against is generated randomly.

## Usage

1. Open your web browser and go to [https://berianlowe.com/number-guess](https://berianlowe.com/number-guess).
2. Type a number between 1 and 10 in the text input.
3. Click guess and see how you did!
4. Enter another number, and click guess again.
